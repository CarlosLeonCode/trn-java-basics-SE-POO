## Definitions - Key concepts

### Abstraction:
When you analyze an object to become it a class representation

### Classes:
Are like molds that allow to us create objects. They are created after abstraction.

### Objects:
are the result of the model (classes)

### Constructors methods:
- This creates new instances of a class.
- It has the same name that the class name.
- it uses the `new` keyword to call it.
- It could have 0 or more arguments.
- It does not return values.

### Static Methods: `(Check UIMenu class as example)`
- We can use them in all the class. That's why they belongs to them not to objects.
- They are defined by `static` keyword
- They are accessed through class name after a dot `.`, e.x:`Class.Method`
